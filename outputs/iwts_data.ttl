  schema:description "In an imaginary letter to her absent older brother, Braidie struggles to understand news stories about the torture and murder of a local teenage girl and how the brutality she sees in the headlines is reflected in her own friend group. Revisiting memories, Braidie tracks her own complicity and participation in the bullying of one girl, and considers what it means to go too far. THE SHAPE OF A GIRL by Joan MacLeod challenges audiences to interrogate their capacity to both help and harm others and to be brave when standing up for what is right.";

Here you’ll find themes of resilience, perseverance, and love within a broken system.";

Mat’s intricate yet unpretentious songwriting tunes classical technique to a modern pitch with percussive, piano-driven melodies that can turn any crowd into an audience of attentive listeners. His sharp, candid lyricism ranges from the playfully slapstick to the knife edge of existential pathos in topics like eco-anxiety, self-estrangement, and feeling homesick for a place you’ve never been. Mat has quickly made a name for himself in the Halifax scene since moving home from BC's Sunshine Coast.";
