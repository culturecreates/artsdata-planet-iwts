I am electric religion.” His latest album, The Taste, straddles pop, rock, and funk – a genre playfully coined as “Métis Disco.\"  Electric Religious has been included twice in the CBC Searchlight Top 100 in recent years, and twice among CKUA’s Top 100 Albums of the year. He has also been honoured with a nomination for Métis Artist of the Year at the Summer Solstice Indigenous Music Awards.";

Rising above economic obstacles and social barriers in the ’20s, she earned the nickname “Brave Bessie” and even her dreams were quite literally sky high. The Flight evokes Bessie’s unshakable optimism, her determination, her vision, and the indomitable self confidence that led her to soar above the clouds, reaching ever closer to the sun.";
