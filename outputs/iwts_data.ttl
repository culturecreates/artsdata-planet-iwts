After musical disappointments in her teens and early twenties, Rainere gave up singing for 20 years.  In 2012, on a whim, she auditioned for the prestigious Legends in Concert and was on the big stage in a matter of weeks.  Since that success, she has amazed audiences not only her spot on vocals, but for the style and essence that was the late Donna Summer.";
