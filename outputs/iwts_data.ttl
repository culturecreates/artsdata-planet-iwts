Using the swirling melodies and glitzed-up production of Top 40, the Nova Scotia-based multidisciplinary artist builds tension between soundscapes primed for pure pleasure and lyrics that address the relationship between desire and despair. Her latest release, The Text Collector, deconstructs poetry and pop music, rebuilding the pieces into a listening experience even richer than the sum of its parts.";

When they write songs together, Liv Cazzola and Braden Phelan evoke humanizing questions with pump organ, singing saw, guitar, and accordion. In harmony, their voices sensitively tread between the impossible fragility of bent porcelain and the nuanced joy of torn fabric lovingly mended. Leading with curiosity, empathy and charm, Cazzola and Phelan share vignettes inside stories inside songs - compelling listeners to consider community in ways that feel both familiar and forward-looking.""";
